# Data Engineering

## Overview

In this repository, you will find resources on data engineering such as data
engineering principles, data engineering software tools and components, etc.

The file [crashcourse.md](crashcourse.md) is a brainstorming of ideas and tools that data
engineers use.

In the document [dataengineering.md](dataengineering.md), I describe principles that guide the design and implementation of software that processes data.

A `git` crash course described in the file [git_basics.md](git_basics.md).

The [etl](etl) folder contains materials to learn to how to write Extract Transform
Load (ETL) and other types of data pipelines.

The [aws](aws) folder contains learning resources for cloud computing using
