# Amazon Web Services

[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) (AWS) is a cloud computing
platform which provides a plethora of computing services such as servers,
storage, databases, messaging and queuing systems, etc. Here, we describe the
most important services as far as data engineers are concerned, and explain how
to interact with them using the console, the command line interface or the
Python SDK (Software Development Kit)
[boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html).

AWS documentation is exhaustive and usually well explained, so we will often
point the reader to official resources, and focus on providing a path to learn
how to use AWS.
